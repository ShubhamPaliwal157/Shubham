I have personal learning experience of coding of 1 year. I have a good knowledge of HTML and CSS. Other than that I am also learning JavaScript. My strength is my creativity. My age is about 16 years and I love designing and creating webpages, that's why when I start typing I don't stop until I'm done, even if the project takes time, I don't give up.
